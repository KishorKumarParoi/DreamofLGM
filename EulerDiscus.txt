Project Euler Problem 1 : 
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

There is two types solution for this problem.Bruteforce and Gauss Formula
Bruteforce:
just iterate through i from range 1 to 1000 and check if i is both divisible by both 3 and 5, then sum+=i and finally print the answer
Complexity : O(n) 
Limitation : It is limited till the value of n is 10^8 

The program runs instantly for the less than 1000 limit but we quickly learn that this method does not scale to larger ranges such as 
1 billion run 100,000 times is less than a second. Such is the demand required to be met by the HackerRank Project Euler 1. So we need 
to find a more efficient way of calculating this sum without looping.
Just Look this version of problem -> https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler001/problem

So we have to find more efficient scalable version
firstly, we all know about the n*(n+1)/2 which is used for getting the sum from 1 to n. We will use this formula's extended version.

Column * Column Sum = (n/2) * (n+1) 

We can adapt this formula to count the numbers only divisible by d to a specific limit; such as n=33, d=3, in the following example.
Remember when there is an odd number we start from zero to keep the columns paired. Here’s how the adaptation works:

 0  3   6   9  12  15
33 30  27  24  21  18
Each column sums to 33 and, using our understanding from above, we calculate 6*33 to find the sum of numbers to 33 that are evenly
divisible by 3 (6*33=198)

d = 3 or 5 or any divisor
m = floor(n/d)
Summation for d's multiple in range = n*(n+1)*d/2

if n = 20, then :
for 3 ->
m = floor(n/3) = 6 & summation of multiples of 3 <=20 -> m*(m+1)*d/2 = 6*7*3/2 = 63 
like 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + 18 = 63
for 5 ->
m = 4, d=5, sum = 4*5*5/2 = 50
like 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 = 50

 Adding those together is almost our answer but we must first subtract the sum of every 15th natural number (3 × 5) as it is counted 
 twice: once in the 3 summation and once again in the 5 summation. such as 15,30,45 both are divisble by 3 and 5 so we have to subtract
 multiples of 15
 
 for 15-> do it yourself :D
